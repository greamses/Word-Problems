# Math Problem Solver - Structured Problem-Solving Application  

## Overview  
Math Problem Solver is an interactive web application designed to help students systematically approach and solve math problems using a structured methodology. The application guides users through key problem-solving steps while integrating powerful math tools and APIs to enhance the learning experience.  

## Key Features  
- **Step-by-Step Problem Analysis**  
  - Circle key numbers and constants  
  - Underline the core question  
  - Box important keywords and phrases  
  - Eliminate irrelevant information  
  - Solve and verify answers  

- **Integrated Math Tools**  
  - Graspable Math API for algebraic manipulation  
  - Desmos Graphing Calculator integration  
  - Polypad virtual math manipulatives  

- **Progress Tracking**  
  - Score system to track completed problems  
  - Visual progress metrics  
  - Problem navigation for continuous practice  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Graspable Math API (for algebraic expressions)  
  - Desmos Graphing Calculator API  
  - Polypad by Mathigon (interactive math workspace)  
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (for saving user progress)  
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  

## Improvements & Optimizations  
- **Refactored UI/UX**  
  - Unified tool toggling system for better usability  
  - Responsive layout for cross-device compatibility  
  - Clear visual feedback for completed steps  

- **Enhanced Tool Integrations**  
  - Dynamic loading of Graspable Math to reduce initial load time  
  - Lazy initialization of Desmos and Polypad for performance  
  - Proper cleanup and reset between problems  

- **State Management**  
  - Persistent progress tracking using LocalStorage  
  - Efficient problem state management  
  - Error handling for API initializations  

- **Performance**  
  - Minimized re-renders through optimized DOM updates  
  - Asynchronous loading of external libraries  
  - Periodic auto-save functionality  

## API Integrations  
1. **Graspable Math API**  
   - Used for building and manipulating algebraic statements  
   - Provides interactive equation editing and solving  
   - Dynamically loaded when needed  

2. **Desmos Graphing Calculator**  
   - Embedded for graphical problem-solving  
   - API used for dynamic equation plotting  

3. **Polypad by Mathigon**  
   - Interactive virtual manipulatives  
   - Supports geometric and algebraic problem-solving  

## How It Works  
1. **Problem Selection**: Choose from a library of math problems.  
2. **Text Analysis**: Use markup tools to identify key problem components.  
3. **Solution Development**:  
   - Build equations using Graspable Math  
   - Visualize concepts with Desmos or Polypad  
4. **Answer Verification**: Check solutions against correct answers.  
5. **Progress Tracking**: View completion metrics and scores.  

## Technical Challenges & Solutions  
- **Challenge**: Managing multiple external library dependencies  
  - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic loading and initialization checks  

- **Challenge**: Persisting complex user interactions  
  - **Solution**: Developed a robust LocalStorage system for state management  

- **Challenge**: Cross-tool interoperability  
  - **Solution**: Created a unified interface for tool toggling and communication  

## Future Enhancements  
- Cloud synchronization for progress across devices  
- Problem generation API integration  
- Collaborative problem-solving features  
- Advanced analytics for learning patterns
